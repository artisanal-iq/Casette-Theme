# PRD: Cassette Brutalist WordPress Theme Completion

## Overview

The goal is to complete and refine the custom WordPress theme "Cassette Brutalist". This theme is built from scratch using Codex and is designed with a brutalist aesthetic that blends retro-futuristic cues with modern accessibility and block editor support.

This project will improve maintainability, flexibility, and usability by structuring theme files, enabling reusable components, registering block patterns, and providing editor-friendly features.

## Goals

* Modularize layout using `template-parts/`
* Enhance editor experience with block patterns
* Provide reusable components for homepage, categories, and resource templates
* Preserve CLI post publishing compatibility
* Maintain minimal conditional logic for performance and clarity

## Features

### Templates

* `category.php` with slug-based routing to custom layouts
* `page-resources.php` with modular sections (intro, cards, dynamic posts, media, CTA)
* `page-landing.php` for promotional landing pages

### Template Parts

* `header.php` (default)
* `header-single.php` (slim header for posts)
* `footer.php`
* `post-card.php`
* `sidebar.php`
* `pagination.php`
* `good-better-best.php`
* `/category/` folder for per-category layout overrides
* `/resources/` folder for modular components of resources page

### Block Patterns

* Good / Better / Best (3-column feature set)
* 3â€“4 Black CTA blocks
* Related Posts Grid
* Hero Section (existing)

### Style System

* Global styles via `:root` in `style.css`
* Block styles in `editor-style.css`
* Utility classes already present

### Editor Support

* Wide alignment
* Editor styles
* Color palette and dynamic accent

## Constraints

* Minimal conditional logic for maintainability
* ACF optional for future extensibility, not current requirement
* Focused on classic theming with block editor support, not FSE

# Roadmap: Cassette Brutalist Theme Completion

## Sprint 0: Setup and Scaffolding

* [ ] Create `/template-parts/` directory and subfolders
* [ ] Create blank PHP partials for headers, footer, post cards, pagination, etc.
* [ ] Create `/resources/` and `/template-parts/category/` folders

## Sprint 1: Template Part Integration

* [ ] Migrate existing inline sections into `get_template_part()` calls

* [ ] Convert `good-better-best.php` into reusable block pattern
* [ ] Register 3 black CTA patterns (pattern + PHP partial)
* [ ] Register Related Posts Grid pattern

## Sprint 3: Category and Archive

* [ ] Build `category.php` router using `get_query_var('category_name')`
